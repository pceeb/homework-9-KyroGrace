# Homework 10

You will fill out the following
questionnaire for each program and submit the answers as your final homework. You will
also share your questionnaire with the group that created the program __by the end of discussion__.
---

### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
  PhyloMicro --> The Readme file is the first document. It includes a title, name, but no contact info.
  
  ShinyApp --> Yes, the Readme if the first file displayed. It includes a title, their names and contact info. 

#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear? What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
  PhyloMicro --> The purpose is clear. It seems that the purpose is to analyze fish gut microbiomes by using their code which allows the user to see how fish gut microbiomes are influenced by the environment, the hosts' diet that they live in, and also the hosts' gender.
  
   Shiny app → The purpose of their program is clear. Their motivation seems to be relating position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. There program allows you to spit out many graphs without having to do them by hand. 

         
#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
  PhyloMicro --> There is a program workflow and it is easy somewhat easy to understand. In essence, you need to import the data, generate a phylogenetic tree, and then analyze alpha and beta diversity. 
  
  Shiny app → There is a program workflow which explains that the program plots a graph using a couple of equations. It also explains that the user can change the values of a, v, and x.
        
#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
PhyloMicro --> The dependencies are there in their own section. There is a specific requirement of just loading Hoffman2.

 Shiny app →  The dependencies are in a different section, but not in the workflow section. There are specific rstudio requirements and packages in rstudio that are indicated. 

      
#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
      PhyloMicro --> There are instructions and they do make sense. I would say maybe elaborate more regarding the subdirectories and what they are. 
      
      Shiny app → There are instructions and they do make sense, however, I think they should also have instructions on how to download the packages from rstudio in case somebody wants to edit their code. 
#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
    PhyloMicro -->  There is and the commands for them are written.
    
    Shiny app → There is a file that shows values that the user can input, but there is nothing that shows what the graph would look like if the user did input those values for the specified variables. I would recommend to add that to the vignette. 

#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
PhyloMicro --> Yes they are. Both are cited.

Shiny app → All of the dependencies are sited for the program. I don't think they have anything from the motivation that needs to be cited. I am also not sure if they used any other research programs to help them. 

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
PhyloMicro --> There is. They also have a broken down scripts directory.

 Shinyapp → There is a directory called Scripts_1DMotionFinal.R that has scripts for the program.

    

#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
PhyloMicro --> They do generate a run log. 

Shinyapp →    N/A. (Because it is a shiny app).


### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
  PhyloMicro --> There is a vignette and it does include a test set with the commands needed to run them.
  
   Shiny app → There is a directory called vignette which includes a test set. However, it does not include what the expected output databases are,so I would say try and add that to help the user see what they should be seeing!

  
#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
PhyloMicro --> I was and the instructions were fairly clear. 

 Shiny app → I was able to. Because this was a shiny app, all I had to do was load the program, input the variables and then I generated a graph. 

 
#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
 PhyloMicro --> I was able to, however I could not see what one of there expected outputs were because the file was to big and when it downloaded to my computer I did not have an app to view it. So that might be a problem for future users. 
 
 Shiny app --> There was no expected output so I am not sure if what I am seeing is technically correct. 


### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
  PhyloMicro --> I would say try to break down the model and idea for this program regarding fish gut microbiomes because it seems to be a complex topic. I would also suggest making an expected output visible on github without requiring the user to have to have an app to view it on their computer. 
  
   Shiny app →  One suggestion would be to include the output for the vignette to help the user see if they are doing generated correct graphs. My other suggestions would be to inlcude what the package in R do and why they were used in building this app. Other than that, this program looks great!
