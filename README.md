# Homework 10

You will fill out the following
questionnaire for each program and submit the answers as your final homework. You will
also share your questionnaire with the group that created the program __by the end of discussion__.
---

### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
  PhyloMicro --> The Readme file is the first document. It includes a title, name, but no contact info.

#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear? What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
  PhyloMicro --> The purpose is clear. It seems that the purpose is to analyze fish gut microbiomes by using their code which allows the user to see how fish gut microbiomes are influenced by the environment, the hosts' diet that they live in, and also the hosts' gender. 
         
#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
  PhyloMicro --> There is a program workflow and it is easy somewhat easy to understand. In essence, you need to import the data, generate a phylogenetic tree, and then analyze alpha and beta diversity. 
        
#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
PhyloMicro --> The dependencies are there in their own section. There is a specific requirement of just loading Hoffman2.
      
#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
      PhyloMicro --> There are instructions and they do make sense. I would say maybe elaborate more regarding the subdirectories and what they are. 
#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
    PhyloMicro -->  There is and the commands for them are written.
#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
PhyloMicro --> Yes they are. Both are cited.
### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
There is. They also have a broken down scripts directory.
    

#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
PhyloMicro --> They do generate a run log.    

### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
  PhyloMicro --> There is a vignette and it does include a test set with the commands needed to run them.
  
#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
PhyloMicro --> I was and the instructions were fairly clear. 
 
#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
 PhyloMicro --> I was able to, however I could not see what one of there expected outputs were because the file was to big and when it downloaded to my computer I did not have an app to view it. So that might be a problem for future users. 

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
  PhyloMicro --> I would say try to break down the model and idea for this program regarding fish gut microbiomes because it seems to be a complex topic. I would also suggest making an expected output visible on github without requiring the user to have to have an app to view it on their computer.
