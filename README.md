# Homework 10

You will fill out the following
questionnaire for each program and submit the answers as your final homework. You will
also share your questionnaire with the group that created the program __by the end of discussion__.
---

### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
  ShinyApp --> Yes, the Readme if the first file displayed. It includes a title, their names and contact info. 

#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear from the Introduction?  What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
          The purpose of their program is clear. Their motivation seems to be relating position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. There program allows you to spit out many graphs without having to do them by hand. 
#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
        There is a program workflow which explains that the program plots a graph using a couple of equations. It also explains that the user can change the values of a, v, and x.
#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
        The dependencies are in a different section, but not in the workflow section. There are specific rstudio requirements and packages in rstudio that are indicated. 
#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
      There are instructions and they do make sense, however, I think they should also have instructions on how to download the packages from rstudio incase somebody wants to edit their code. 
#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
      There is a file that shows values that the user can input, but there is nothing that shows what the graph would look like if the user did input those values for the specified variables. I would recommend to add that to the vignette. 
#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
---     All of the dependencies are sited for the program. I don't think they have anything from the motivation that needs to be cited. I am also not sure if they used any other research programs to help them. 

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
      There is a directory called Scripts_1DMotionFinal.R that has scripts for the program.

#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
---       These prorams do generate a run log 

### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
  There is a directory called vignette which includes a test set. However, it does not include what the expected output databases are,so I would say try and add that to help the user see what they should be seeing!

#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
  I was able to. Because this was a shiny app, all I had to do was load the program, input the variables and then I generated a graph. 

#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
---   There was no expected output so I am not sure if what I am seeing is techinically correct. 

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
  One suggestion would be to include the output for the vignette to help the user see if they are doing generated correct graphs. My other suggestions would be to inlcude what the packaed in R do and why they were used in building this app. Other than that, this program looks great!
